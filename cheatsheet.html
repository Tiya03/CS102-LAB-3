    <h1 id="con2">NITRO TIPS</h1>
    <p id="con3">Nitro is one of your most important tools in Asphalt 9: Legends. It allows you to accelerate your car,
      achieve a
      better rank, and maintain your lead on other racers. To upgrade it, you have to use credits to improve your car,
      whereas to charge it, you have a few options at your disposal. These include drifting and performing stunts.</p>

        width="50%"></p>
    <p id="con3">Drifting is not only a great way to charge your Nitro, but also the best way to take many sharp turns
      and leave
      your opponents behind in the process. Even a short tap on your break can sometimes set you up for a better
      position once you complete a turn or perform a stunt and are about to press Nitro</p>

        width="50%"></p>
    <p id="con3">Aside from drifting, the two stunts you can perform in Asphalt 9 are 360 turns and barrel rolls. The
      former charges your Nitro for about 40% and can help you change your direction, but takes quite a while to
      execute, so it should be used with care. Barrel rolls, on the other hand, can only be performed by hitting a
      curved ramp, which usually sets your car flying and can give you an advantage over other players.</p>
