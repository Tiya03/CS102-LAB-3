      <a name="about">
      <pre style="font-size:45px"><b style="color: brown;" >ABOUT THE GAME</b><heading2>
      The gameplay in Asphalt 9 is similar to the other Asphalt Games with noticeable differences in graphics and design.
      There were 48 cars featured in the game when soft-launched, but the worldwide release saw the introduction of four 
      new cars, leading to 52 cars.
      
      There are currently 167 cars as of the May 2022 update. Like its predecessor, each of the cars belongs to a class 
      progressively featuring higher performance and rarity: D, C, B, A, and S. The player starts with a car in the lowest 
      class (Class D), the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X. All cars in the game now require "blueprints" or "key" to unlock 
      and then subsequently "star up" using "blueprints", with each of them having anywhere from 3 to 6 stars. For each new 
      star, the car's performance capability is increased (at the cost of a lesser fuel tank quantity). Each car can also be 
      customized with the new car editor feature.
      
      Upon unlocking a car, the player can choose from a few official stock colors. Once the car has been starred up at least once, 
      the player can create custom paint job colors to the body, rims, and brake calipers for most models. Some models also allow for 
      carbon parts on the hood, trunk, and wings. Several cars are also convertibles (they can be converted from closed roofs to open
      ones in-game), like the BMW Z4 LCI E89, the Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport, and the McLaren 570S Spider. Introduced in the 2019
      Summer Update, several cars like the Mercedes-AMG GTS could have special tires, rims, and changes to the bodywork added to the
      car. Also new to the series are "clubs", where up to 20 players can collaboratively score “reputation points” to achieve rewards.
      The more reputation points the club scores, the better rewards, ranging from credits to blueprints for cars.
      
      The game also features "nitro shockwave", returning from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and Asphalt 7: Heat. When the player has a full
      nitro bar and taps twice on the Nitro button, a purple pulse is released from the vehicle while the car's speed increases. 
      On mobile platforms, Asphalt 9 has three control schemes: Tilt to Steer, Tap to Steer, and the brand new "Touch Drive" in which
      the player selects routes and stunts by swiping left and right. Touch Drive is intended for beginners and casual players. On
      Windows 10 devices, Touch Drive and manual controls can be used with the keyboard; or with a tilt to steer, if the device has
      a touchscreen and an accelerometer.
      
      In the game, there are three playing modes: Career, Multiplayer, Events, and Special Events (including Grand Prix). In career mode,
      the player participates in an extensive single-player campaign consisting of five chapters, each containing several series of races
      focusing on a certain car class or manufacturer. In Multiplayer, the player competes against other online players in real-time. 
      In Events, the player participates in a daily or weekly competition to beat other players' times or earn other items.
      
      There are also "Special Events", which were introduced in the Bugatti Chiron special event in December 2018, and have continued 
      since with the introduction of "Drive Syndicate" events in July 2019 and, more recently, another special event released on July 
      31, 2020, starting with the SSC Tuatara. Since the "Godly Beasts Update", a new type of Special Event called "Grand Prix" has been 
      launched, starting with the Techrules AT96 Track Edition Grand Prix. Players compete against other players for rewards, including the
      Key for the featured Grand Prix car. Once a player obtains a Key, they can instantly unlock the car. This is the only way in the game 
      to unlock a car without Blueprints.
      
      Drive Syndicate events have received much criticism due to their high requirements to play and paywalls (where the player needs to
      spend real money to continue playing). The first, third, and fourth Drive Syndicate events were the most difficult and expensive 
      events because of the presence of paywalls that were nearly impossible to avoid if the player hasn't played in the previously-occurring 
      events. Due to this, Drive Syndicate events are among the most hated events in the entire game, with the least-hated one being the 
      second as it had no paywalls and only needed a lot of playtime.
      
      There are 4 race types in Asphalt 9. The "classic" race mode from previous games has returned alongside new races, "Time Attack", 
      "Hunted" and "Slipstream". In Time Attack, the player has to cross the finish line within a time limit. In Hunted, the player must
      escape a police pursuit in a car chase without getting busted or running out of time. The player must also avoid wrecking their car, 
      for if they do, they are immediately busted. In "Slipstream", which is similar to classic race, cars leave behind the slipstream line 
      and when driving over this, it fills up nitro very fast.
      
      The game features a number of race tracks set in new locations: Cairo (including Giza), the Himalayas, Wyoming (named U.S. Midwest), 
      Scotland, the Caribbean, Auckland (featuring street circuit-inspired aesthetics), and Buenos Aires. It also brings back several 
      locations from previous games in the series: San Francisco, Rome, Shanghai, Osaka, New York and Nevada.
